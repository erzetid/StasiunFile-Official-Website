					<b
						>Your Data Protection Rights under the California
						Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</b
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require
					commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
					policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to
					require a person or company in the United States (and
					conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting
					personally identifiable information from California
					consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its
					website stating exactly the information being collected and
					those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to
					comply with this policy.
				</p>
				<p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
				<p>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</p>
				<p>
					0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”,
					and can easily be found on the home page of our website;
				</p>
				<p>
					0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on
					our Privacy Policy Page;
				</p>
				<p>
					0.4. users are able to change their personal information by
					emailing us at <b>fahrizalm14@gmail.com</b>.
				</p>
				<p>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</p>
				<p>
					We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant
					cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser
					mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can
					set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not
					want to be tracked.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the
					Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.
				</p>
				<p>
					12.
					<b
						>Your Data Protection Rights under the California
						Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</b
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn
					what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data and
					not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection
					rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:
				</p>
				<p>
					<b
						>0.1. What personal information we have about you. If
						you make this request, we will return to you:</b
